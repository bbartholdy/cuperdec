Description: This library contains helper functions to generate cumulative 
    percent 'decay' curves, which are calculated from metagenomic taxonomic 
    profiles. These can be used to estimate the level of 'endogenous' taxa 
    retrieved from metagenomic samples, when comparing to samples of known
    sampling site or source.
