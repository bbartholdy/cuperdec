R library to generate 'Cumulative Percent Decay' curves for microbial taxonomic 
profiles.

These curves aim to represent the level of 'endogenous' content of microbiome 
samples, such as ancient dental calculus, to help to identify samples with low
levels of preservation that should be discarded for downstream analysis.
